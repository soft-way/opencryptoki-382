.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBpkcscca\fP utility assists in administering the CCA token.

In version 2 of opencryptoki, CCA private token objects were encrypted in CCA
hardware. In version 3 these objects are encrypted in software. The
\fBv2objectsv3\fP migration option migrates these v2 objects by
decrypting them in CCA hardware using a secure key and then re-encrypting
them in software using a software key. Afterwards, v2 objects can be accessed
in version 3.

There may be situations where CCA master keys must be changed. All CCA secret
and private keys are wrapped with a master key. After a CCA master key is
changed, keys wrapped with the old master key need to be re-wrapped with the
current master key. The \fBkeys\fP migration option migrates these wrapped keys
by unwrapping them with the old master key and wrapping them with the current
master key.

.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB-d|--datastore\fP \fIdirectory\fp" 10
the directory where the CCA token information is kept. This directory will be
used to locate the private token objects to be migrated. i.e. /var/lib/opencryptoki/ccatok
.IP "\fB-v|--verbose\fP" 5
Provide more detailed output

.SH "VERSION MIGRATION"
.IP "\fB-m v2objectsv3\fP" 5
Migrates CCA private token objects from CCA encryption (used in v2) to software
encryption (used in v3).

.SH "KEY MIGRATION"
.IP "\fB-m keys\fP" 5
Unwraps private keys with an old CCA master key and wraps them with a new CCA
master key.
.IP "\fB-k aes|apka|asym|sym\fP" 5
Migrate keys wrapped with the selected master key type.
.IP "\fB-s|--slotid\fP \fISLOTID\fP" 5
The PKCS slot number.

.SH "FILES"
.IP "/var/lib/opencryptoki/ccatok/TOK_OBJ/OBJ.IDX"
contains current list of public and private token objects for the CCA token.
